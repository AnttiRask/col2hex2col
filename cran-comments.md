* This is a new release (first submission to CRAN).

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the LICENSE file format to use the template format (YEAR/COPYRIGHT HOLDER) instead of the full license text, which resolves the "License stub is invalid DCF" NOTE from the previous submission.

## Test environments

* local Linux Mint 22.2, R 4.5.2
* GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest): devel, release, oldrel-1
* GitHub Actions (windows-latest): release
* GitHub Actions (macos-latest): release

All tests pass on all platforms.
