\title{Convert Color Names to Hex Codes}
\usage{
color_to_hex(color)
}
\arguments{
\item{color}{A character vector of R color names (e.g., "red", "blue", "skyblue").
Color names are case-sensitive and must match exactly as returned by
\code{\link[grDevices]{colors}}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of hexadecimal color codes in the format "#RRGGBB",
where each pair of characters represents the red, green, and blue components
in hexadecimal notation (00-FF). The returned vector has the same length as
the input.
}
\description{
Converts R color names to their hexadecimal color code representations.
This function accepts any valid R color name from the 657 built-in colors
available in \code{\link[grDevices]{colors}}.
}
\details{
The function performs input validation and will raise an error if:
\itemize{
\item The input is not a character vector
\item Any NA values are present
\item Any invalid color names are provided
}

This function is vectorized and efficiently handles both single colors and
vectors of multiple colors.
}
\examples{
# Convert a single color
color_to_hex("red")

# Convert multiple colors
color_to_hex(c("red", "blue", "green"))

# Works with all R color names
color_to_hex(c("skyblue", "coral", "chartreuse"))

# Use in a data visualization context
colors <- c("steelblue", "firebrick", "forestgreen")
hex_codes <- color_to_hex(colors)
# hex_codes can now be used with plotting functions
}
