\title{Convert Hex Codes to Color Names}
\usage{
hex_to_color(hex)
}
\arguments{
\item{hex}{A character vector of hexadecimal color codes in the format "#RRGGBB"
(e.g., "#FF0000", "#0000FF"). The hash symbol (#) is required, and the hex
code is case-insensitive. Each component (RR, GG, BB) must be a two-digit
hexadecimal value (00-FF).}
}
\value{
A character vector of color names (in lowercase). If a hex code does not have a
corresponding named color in the database, \code{NA} is returned for that element.
The returned vector has the same length as the input.
}
\description{
Converts hexadecimal color codes to their corresponding color names.
This function searches through an extensive database of over 32,000 color names,
prioritizing R's built-in color names when available.
}
\details{
The function performs input validation and will raise an error if:
\itemize{
\item The input is not a character vector
\item Any NA values are present
\item Any hex codes are not in the correct "#RRGGBB" format
}

This function is case-insensitive for the hex values (e.g., "#FF0000" and
"#ff0000" are treated identically).

\strong{Name Selection Strategy}: When multiple color names map to the same hex code:
\enumerate{
\item R's built-in color names are prioritized (from \code{\link[grDevices]{colors}})
\item If no R color exists, the shortest name from the extended database is returned
}

This ensures backward compatibility with R's color system while providing coverage
for the 32,161 unique hex codes in the extended database.

The extended database includes colors from \url{https://github.com/meodai/color-names},
significantly increasing the likelihood of finding a named match for any given hex code.

\examples{
# Convert a single hex code
hex_to_color("#FF0000")

# Convert multiple hex codes
hex_to_color(c("#FF0000", "#0000FF", "#00FF00"))

# Case insensitive
hex_to_color("#ff0000")  # Same as "#FF0000"

# Works with extended color database
hex_to_color("#FF6347")  # Returns a descriptive color name

# Returns NA for colors without named equivalents (rare)
hex_to_color("#ABCDEF")

# Round-trip conversion
original <- c("red", "blue", "green")
hex_codes <- color_to_hex(original)
hex_to_color(hex_codes)  # Returns original color names
}
