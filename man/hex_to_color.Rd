\title{Convert Hex Codes to Color Names}
\usage{
hex_to_color(hex)
}
\arguments{
\item{hex}{A character vector of hexadecimal color codes in the format "#RRGGBB"
(e.g., "#FF0000", "#0000FF"). The hash symbol (#) is required, and the hex
code is case-insensitive. Each component (RR, GG, BB) must be a two-digit
hexadecimal value (00-FF).}
}
\value{
A character vector of R color names. If a hex code does not have a
corresponding named color in R's color palette, \code{NA} is returned for
that element. The returned vector has the same length as the input.
}
\description{
Converts hexadecimal color codes to their corresponding R color names.
This function searches through R's built-in color names to find exact matches
for the provided hex codes.
}
\details{
The function performs input validation and will raise an error if:
\itemize{
\item The input is not a character vector
\item Any NA values are present
\item Any hex codes are not in the correct "#RRGGBB" format
}

This function is case-insensitive for the hex values (e.g., "#FF0000" and
"#ff0000" are treated identically). When multiple color names map to the same
hex code, the first color name in R's \code{\link[grDevices]{colors}} list is
returned.

Note that not all possible hex codes have corresponding named colors in R.
R provides 657 unique color names, but many hex codes will not have exact matches.

\examples{
# Convert a single hex code
hex_to_color("#FF0000")

# Convert multiple hex codes
hex_to_color(c("#FF0000", "#0000FF", "#00FF00"))

# Case insensitive
hex_to_color("#ff0000")  # Same as "#FF0000"

# Returns NA for colors without named equivalents
hex_to_color("#123456")

# Round-trip conversion
original <- c("red", "blue", "green")
hex_codes <- color_to_hex(original)
hex_to_color(hex_codes)  # Returns original color names
